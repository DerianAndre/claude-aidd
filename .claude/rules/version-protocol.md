## 1. Overview

The Version Verification Protocol prevents the generation of code that targets outdated, deprecated, or non-existent APIs. It runs before any implementation work begins and produces a verified stack profile that governs all subsequent code generation.

The protocol operates on a single principle: **never trust training data over project reality**. The `package.json` is the source of truth for what versions are installed. Documentation for the current year is the source of truth for what APIs exist.

## 2. Protocol Steps

### STEP 1 — DETECT PROJECT STACK

**Objective**: Build a complete dependency inventory from project files.

Actions:
- Read `package.json` at the project root. Extract all `dependencies` and `devDependencies` with exact versions.
- If a monorepo structure is detected (workspace configuration, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`, `lerna.json`), read `package.json` in every workspace package.
- Extract exact versions of ALL major dependencies. Strip version prefixes (`^`, `~`) to identify the minimum installed version.
- Note the package manager and its version (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun).
- Check for framework-specific configuration files (e.g., `vite.config.ts`, `next.config.js`, `astro.config.mjs`) to confirm framework presence.

**Output**: A dependency map of `{ package: version }` for all significant dependencies.

### STEP 2 — LOAD PROJECT CONTEXT

**Objective**: Discover and load project-specific conventions, memory, and configuration.

Actions:
- Check for Claude Code structure (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/agents/` + `.claude/rules/`): if found, load `CLAUDE.md` as the source of truth for agent behavior.
- Check for project-specific configuration (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`): read for project conventions.

**Output**: Loaded project conventions, known decisions, and prior mistakes.

### STEP 3 — VERIFY DOCUMENTATION

**Objective**: Ensure generated code targets APIs that exist in the detected versions.

Actions:
- For any framework or library being used, search for documentation from the current year.
- Check if specialized context tools exist for the framework (documentation servers, context providers, API references).
- If no specialized context source exists, suggest finding or creating one.
- Verify that any API, method, or pattern being used exists in the detected version, not just in the latest version.
- Prefer current-year documentation over training data. Training data may reference APIs from older or newer versions.

**Output**: Verified API surface for all major dependencies.

### STEP 4 — ANTI-LEGACY FILTER

**Objective**: Reject patterns that belong to older versions of detected dependencies.

Actions:
- Cross-reference generated code patterns against the detected version.
- Reject known deprecated patterns for the installed version.
- If uncertain about whether an API exists in a specific version, state the uncertainty explicitly. Do not silently generate potentially invalid code.
- Flag stale training data: when using knowledge that may be outdated, note it.
- Never generate code using deprecated APIs without an explicit warning and rationale.

**Output**: Confidence level (high/medium/low) for each major API usage.

## 3. Anti-Legacy Patterns

Common version-sensitive patterns to watch for (non-exhaustive, illustrative):

| Framework    | Version | Reject                                   | Use Instead                                          |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Tailwind CSS | >= 4.0  | `tailwind.config.js`, `content` array    | CSS-only `@theme` configuration                      |
| React        | >= 19   | Class components, legacy context API     | Server Components, `use()` hook, concurrent features |
| Astro        | >= 5.0  | `getStaticPaths` with old collection API | Content Layer API with `loader`, Astro Actions       |
| Next.js      | >= 15   | `pages/` router (for new projects)       | `app/` router, Server Actions                        |
| Zod          | >= 4.0  | `.parse()` without error handling        | Check for API changes in v4                          |
| Vitest       | >= 4.0  | Legacy configuration keys                | Verify config schema against v4 docs                 |

This table is illustrative. The actual patterns to reject depend on the project's detected versions. Always verify against current documentation rather than relying on a static list.

**Key rule**: When in doubt, verify. The cost of checking documentation is negligible compared to the cost of debugging code that targets a non-existent API.
